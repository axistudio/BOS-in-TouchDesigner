I can't say enough good things about [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) by  [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/) & [Jen Lowe](http://jenlowe.net/). If you're looking to get a handle on how to write shaders, or find some inspiration this is an incredible resource.  

For TouchDesigner programers who are accostomed to the nodal environment of TD, working with straight code might feel a bit daunting - and making the transition from Patrico's incredible resource to Touch might feel hard - it certianly was for me at first. This repo is really about helping folks make that jump. 

Here you'll find the incredible examples made by Patricio and Jen ported to the TouchDesigner environment. There are some differences here, and I'll do my best to help provide some clarity about where those come from.
